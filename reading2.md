## How to build a PC https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Computer

1) Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
 Both cores and speed are important, and generally depends on the use of the computer. For general use however more cores is better because many applications use multiple threads at the same time. For daily use 6 cores is good, but for high end PCs you should look at getting more. My gaming PC for example has 8, and if it had less it wouldn't be able to run high preformance games. 

2) What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
   The details you should look at are as follows:
   1) Compatable with your processor
   2) Onboard Wi-Fi (however ethernet is a more stable connection- yet more limiting as it is chorded)
   3) Multiple RAM slots/high RAM capacity
   4) Support for graphics cards if necessary (PCIe x16 slot)

3) What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
   Generally speaking SSDs are better than HDDs in everything except price point. SSDs are faster, smaller, and contains no moving parts. Something to keep in mind if you are working with an older system that doesnt have SATA connectors HDDs can have IDE connectors instead. If the price of a full SSD storage system is out of budget you can use a smaller SSD (200-500GB) as a boot drive to run the opperating system along with a HDD for general storage.

4) Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with? 
  1) Processor/CPU- The processor is the "brain" of the computer. Every process has to come through the CPU first, and the CPU tells other parts of your computer what to do. Just like how your brain tells you lungs to breath or your arm to move.
  2) Motherboard- The motherboard is essentially the central connecting point. Everything plugs into the motherboard and the CPU sends information through the motherboard into the other componants and visa verse.
  3) RAM/Random Access Memory- RAM is temporary storage, essentially the computer puts the active applications on the RAM while the inactive ones stay on the harddrive. This allows for active processes to take priority and run efficiently.
  4) Storage Drive/SSD/HDD- This is your inactive storage. Your documents, downloaded files, etc. are all stored here.
  5) Power Supply- The power supply brings power from the wall socket to the computer, and sends it to every componant. Simply put, it powers the computer.
  6) Case- This is the "box" you put your parts in. It also keep everything grounded/flush, promotes air flow, and helps prevent physical damage to your PC.
  7) Graphics Card- The graphics card renders images. Motherboards have something called "integrated graphics" which is basically a graphics card pre embeded into the motherboard. Integrated graphics are fine for daily use, but are incredibly sub par when it comes to anything that requires highly rendered images. This could include gaming, photography, animation, etc. If you need a better graphics card you can get a separate unit that connects to the PCIe.
  8) Cooling system- The cooling system keeps your PC at a safe temperature. Daily use PCs usually use fans only, but higher end PCs have adapted liquid cooling along with a fan system.

## Things I want to know more about
I want to learn more about how a motherboard works. I understand that it connects everything, but I dont really understand more than that. What specific parts of the board to what etc.

1) Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
 Both cores and speed are important, and generally depends on the use of the computer. For general use however more cores is better because many applications use multiple threads at the same time. For daily use 6 cores is good, but for high end PCs you should look at getting more. My gaming PC for example has 8, and if it had less it wouldn't be able to run high preformance games. 

3) What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
   The details you should look at are as follows:
       -compatable with your processor
       -Onboard Wi-Fi (however ethernet is a more stable connection- yet more limiting as it is chorded)
       -Multiple RAM slots/high RAM capacity
       -Support for graphics cards if necessary (PCIe x16 slot)

5) What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?

6) Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?

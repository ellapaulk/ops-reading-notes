1) What makes the Linksys WRT54GL famous?
   The device is famous because it is built to last in an age where consumerism encourages companies to build lemon devices.
3) Given it’s age, why do people continue to buy the Linksys WRT54GL?
   According to La Duca, big factors include the product's reliability, name recognition, and its support of open source firmware to unlock more advanced capabilities.

    Occasionally the WRT54GL gets updates, two recentsly. One to adress a manufacturing issue and another to fix several security vulnerabilities.

## What I want to learn more about
I honestly felt the article was very comprehensive. If I had to find something I would be curious about why a device that directly competes with the WRT54GL hasnt been produced, or if it has, what pitfalls have stopped it from completely invalidating the old tech.

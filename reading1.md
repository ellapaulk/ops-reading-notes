### China's Spy Chip

We are learning about identifying hardware and becoming familliar with computer parts. This relates because hardware hacks directly modify computer componants.

1) How is a hardware hack different from a software hack?
  A hardware hack is different froma software hack because it is more difficult to pull off, but also potentially more devastating. Hardwear hacks are long term because it effects the infastructure of companies by creating a nearly impossible to track physical link. You cannot know if a computer is effected without opening it up and physically inspecting it. Hardware hacks unlike softwear creative a real-world trail instead of a digital one. This looks like invoice, shipping manifests, etc.
2) What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?
  One way for spies to alter a computers hardware is known as interdiction. Interdiction consists of manipulating the devices as they are moving between manufacturer and customer. The other method involves creating changes from the beginning in manufacturing.
3) Explain how the hack worked.
   The hack worked by implanting a chip into the motherboard that allowed the attercks to create a "stealth doorway" into any network that the computers connected to. This was done by the second aformentioned method, implanted while the original motherboard was manufactured.
4) How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
  Investigators looked into the physical paper trail and eventually found informants in Taiwan and China. They even tracked key individuals through phones. They were able to track the cips to four subcontracting factories that had been in comission with Supermicro motherboards for at least two years. They monitored these facilities and interactions between the Chinese officials, motherboard manufactureres, and middlemen. Plan managers were approached by people who claimed to represent Supermicro or held positions adjacent or in connection with government. They would request changes, offer bribes, or even threaten. Investigators found that this was the world of a People's Liberation Army; specifically a unit specializing in hardware attacks.

## Things I want to know more about
I'd like to know more about the specfics behind the chip itself. I understand the basics of how it worked; essentially just opening a door. But was it designed to run a program or was it simply remote access?

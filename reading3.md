## Startup Sequences and BIOS- https://www.learncomputerscienceonline.com/bios/

1) What is the BIOS?
  BIOS stands for Basic Input OUtput System. The BIOS is a fundemental componant of a PCs firmware. It provides the instructions for the system to boot up and initialize hardware componants during startup. The BIOS is part of the motherboard and is stored in a non-volatile memory chip

2) Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
   During the booting process the BIOS essentially "wakes up" all of the different hardware parts and ensures they work together to allow the operating system to load and run properly.

3) What is the “Power On Self Test”?
  The power supply unit carries out a self test called POST. It checks the computer systems internal hardware components for compatibility, connection, and will ensure that no errors exist before loading the operating system.

4) What is the CMOS?
  The CMOS is the "Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor." It is a type of technology used to produce integrated circuits. PCs use the CMOS chip to store critical data used by the OS during the booting process.

5) What is the CMOS battery?
   The CMOS batter retains stored data (BIOS settings) even after the computer is switched off.

## Things I want to learn more about
Id like to learn more about what editing the bios/cmos does and how to read that information.

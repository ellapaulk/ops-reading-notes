## The Linux command line for beginners
https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview

1) Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
   shell- the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and sends them to the OS to execute.
   terminal- the application that you open to write the commands in and see the visual output back.
   cli- command line interface
   command prompt- A way of asking you to open a terminal to get to a shell
   We still use these today essentially for colloquialisms. If it functions essentially for the same purpose- keep it simple.
   
2) What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
   cd change directories
   ls list contents
   mv rename or move files
   
3) What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
   ~ "starting from my home directory"
   / the "/" directory is sometimes referred to as the "root" directory. "Root is also the name that has been used for the superuser since the early days of Unix.

4) Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.
   cat /etc/oc-release

## What I want to learn more about:
This might not technically be answering the question, but I really want to learn to be fluid about using these commands. I'm excited to get to the point where I dont have to "re-look up" how to create a file in the terminal etc.
